# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The Boston Housing dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and is often used for regression tasks. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains various attributes related to housing in Boston. The features include information such as crime rate, number of rooms, pupil-teacher ratio, etc.

## Project Structure
- **data:** Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src:** Source code for the house price prediction model.
- **models:** Saved models after training.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train_model.py
Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess its performance.
Future Work
Incorporate additional features for better prediction accuracy.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.
Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
